# Language Clock
 This watch-face is designed for language learners. Below the standard 12 hour digital clock, the current hours and minutes are displayed written in the selected language. This gives language learners an opportunity to practice the use of foreign words for numbers in a practical setting. The displayed language is selected in the watch-face settings screen on the user's phone. The displayed color for the watch-face can also be set in the settings screen.
